## Overview

This lesson is designed to be run on a personal computer.
All of the software and data used in this lesson are freely available online,
and instructions on how to obtain them are provided below.

## Install Python

In this lesson, we will be using Python 3 with some of its most popular scientific libraries. Unlike previous lessons we will refrain from using Anaconda as our install of Python and will not use it as our environment manager.


## Launch Python interface

To start working with Python, we need to launch a program that will interpret and execute our
Python commands. Below we list several options. If you don't have a preference, proceed with the
top option in the list that is available on your machine. Otherwise, you may use any interface
you like. Ideally we will be using VS Code.

## Install the AWS CLI

To manage our profile/IAM on aws, install the AWS CLI.

## Install SAM CLI

The SAM CLI is a tool for managing the upload of serverless application models using the Serverless Application Model.

We choose SAM over Serverless (SLS) because it works better with Python.
