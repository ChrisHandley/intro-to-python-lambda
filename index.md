The best way to learn how to program is to do something useful,
so this introduction to Python Flask is built around a common task:
**creating an endpoint**.

### What is an Endpoint
We are creating a Flask app - which in essence is a app that will sit on a server
and has some URLs associated with it - our endpoints - and by messaging these we can
get a response or trigger some work.

Flask endpoints can be rather basic, and display nothing but just return some information
in the form of a json file. Or the endpoint can render a full webpage, that can include forms
for us to input data that is then used for some task.
